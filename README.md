- Slack reporter with integration with CircleCI
  - Reports Github/BitBucket Triggering Commit Details
  - Reports CirleCI Build Logs / Status / Artefacts
  - Reports Test Status & Provides Report Links
- Takes the output of Mochawesome JSON output to determine test result & corresponding slack message
- Provides a URL link to the Test Artefacts (Mochawesome HTML Test Report / Cypress Video & Screenshots)
- Programatically run Cypress via a script file with full report generation and Slack Reporting.

For users who are not using CircleCi, you can get a simple report

- pass `--ci-provider none` provider flag to provide a simple slack message based on the mochawesome report status
- Pass `--custom-url` along with `--ci-provider custom` to set custom report page url. that will be sent to slack.

For jenkins users

- pass `--ci-provider jenkins` provider flag.

## Installation

Note _Please see the pre-requisites folder to current neccessary pre-requisites_

1. Install the app

   \$ yarn add cypress-slack-reporter --dev

   or

   \$ npm install cypress-slack-reporter --save-dev

2. Create a Slack app & create an incoming webhook

## CircleCI

This project is building in CircleCI and can be viewed at the following link

[CircleCI Build](https://circleci.com/gh/YOU54F/cypress-slack-reporter)

See the `.circleci` folder

- `config.yml` - Contains the CircleCI build configuration

The following env vars are read for CircleCI users.

- `CIRCLE_SHA1` - The SHA1 hash of the last commit of the current build
- `CIRCLE_BRANCH` - The name of the Git branch currently being built.
- `CIRCLE_USERNAME` - The GitHub or Bitbucket username of the user who triggered the build.
- `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL` - The URL for the current build.
- `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM` - The number of the CircleCI build.
- `CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST` - Comma-separated list of URLs of the current buildâ€™s associated pull requests.
- `CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME` - The name of the repository of the current project.
- `CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME` - The GitHub or Bitbucket username of the current project.
- `CI_URL="https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project"`
- `CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID` - This project ID used in artefact URLS

If you wish to use another CI provider, you can pass any name other than `circleci` into the CLI flag `--ci-provider`, which will allow you to enter your own environment variables for CI.

- `CI_URL`
- `CI_SHA1`,
- `CI_BRANCH`,
- `CI_USERNAME`,
- `CI_BUILD_URL`,
- `CI_BUILD_NUM`,
- `CI_PULL_REQUEST`,
- `CI_PROJECT_REPONAME`
- `CI_PROJECT_USERNAME`

### CircleCI Artifact Notes

CircleCI have recently changed the API for retrieving API's. A URL is generated for artifacts in the format

`https://${CI_BUILD_NUM}-${CI_PROJECT_ID}-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0`

You can get the `CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID` by checking [https://circleci.com/docs/api/#artifacts-of-a-build](https://circleci.com/docs/api/#artifacts-of-a-build)

For example. the ID for this project is `177880476`, you can see it in the following URL

`https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/YOU54F/cypress-slack-reporter/1/artifacts`

which will return

```json
[ {
  "path" : "root/app/mochareports/.gitignore",
  "pretty_path" : "root/app/mochareports/.gitignore",
  "node_index" : 0,
  "url" : "https://1-177880476-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/root/app/mochareports/.gitignore"
},
...
]
```

In order to correctly construct your artifact URL, you will need to manually retrieve this ID and set it as an env var titled `CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID`

`EXPORT CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID=177880476`

in windows

`SET CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID=177880476`

or in your CircleCI project's environment page.

There is also another workaround by setting a destination option in store_artifacts job in config.yml (CircleCI).

```
- store_artifacts:
          path: ~/path/to/cypress/videos
          destination: cypress/videos
```

will allow you to access artifacts through
https://${CI_BUILD_NUM}-${CI_PROJECT_ID}-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/cypress/videos/some_test_result.mp4

This is what it says on CircleCI Documentation:

```
Currently, store_artifacts has two keys: path and destination.

path is a path to the file or directory to be uploaded as artifacts.
destination (Optional) is a prefix added to the artifact paths in the artifacts API. The directory of the file specified in path is used as the default.
```

## Scripted Runner

An example script is [here](./src/cli/spec.ts) as `cli/spec/ts`

A example of how you can use this script in your project to:-

- Run Cypress with Mochawesome & junit reporters
- Merge mochawesome reports with `mochawesome-merge`
- Construct a slack alert with the merged report, screenshots and videos

Either with the cli

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cypress-slack-reporter-full
```

Or with your own script

```bash
rm -rf ./cypress/reports/mocha && npx ts-node script.ts
```

It can be called with the following options

```
interface SlackRunnerOptions {
  ciProvider: string;
  vcsRoot: string;
  reportDir: string;
  videoDir: string;
  screenshotDir: string;
  customUrl?: string;
  onlyFailed?: boolean;
}
```

And will return a Slack IncomingWebhookResult.
